]# H1 Cecil Cromwell in 'The Judgement of Pharaoh'
"Sonali Pustam"
It was hard to find something I was interested in because I am very very very behind on my assignments (as you most likely know), so I have not looked at a lot of the content of my week (April 15th, 1907). However, I did find one section that mentioned a Cecil Cromwell performing in a play called “The Judgement of Pharaoh”. The article calls her a very beautiful actress from Adelphi. This made me wonder about her relation to Lord Cromwell. Was she casted in the play because of any relation to him? According to one source I found, her role was ‘Mariam’, which, looking at the cast list, appears to not be a main role. It is in the middle of the list order. I don’t know if they did cast list orders differently back then, but the lower the name, the less major the part.
